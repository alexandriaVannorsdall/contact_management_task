# Contact Management Notes

* Database information is in the config file. I used PHPStorm to open it up and write queries to
create the database contact_managment ( I am aware that there is a typo as well) and then the list_contact 
table with data.

### Methods that are included in the contactManager file:

* List all emails with the most recently added one first
* Add an email address without reloading the page
* Delete an email address without reloading the page

The index.html file is a good start ,but I could not finish it in 2 hours.
